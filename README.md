# Cancer-analysis-with-BioModels-Database
This repository consists of techniques that were developed to solve a bioinformatics thesis. 
The main objective was to analyze the models present in the BioModels Database and extract information such as the reactions, 
metabolites and genes present for each patient. Finally, this data is used in conjunction with Clinical Data information for each patient, 
where we will use machine learning techniques.

Dataframes have been created for various types of cancer. 
But liver and breast cancer were the ones that were given the most importance.
